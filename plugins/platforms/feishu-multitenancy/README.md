# Feishu Multitenancy Plugin

Route one Feishu bot to multiple isolated Hermes profiles.

This bundled plugin is opt-in. It uses the `pre_gateway_dispatch` hook to
intercept Feishu messages before the default gateway dispatch, resolve the real
sender `open_id`, and run the message against a per-user Hermes profile.

## How it works

1. `register(ctx)` installs a `pre_gateway_dispatch` hook. Feishu messages are
   skipped from normal dispatch and handled by the plugin router.
2. The router resolves a canonical Feishu sender `open_id` (`ou_*`) from
   context, event fields, or raw Feishu payloads. Alternate IDs are legacy route
   lookup helpers only.
3. `multitenancy_routing.open_id -> profile_name` selects a Hermes profile under
   `~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/`; route misses may auto-provision
   `feishu_<open_id>` when enabled.
4. Normal turns run through the AIAgent subprocess with the routed profile's
   `HERMES_HOME` and sender open_id scope.
5. Cron/reminder jobs created inside that subprocess are bound back to the
   shared gateway Hermes home (`~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`) because the single
   gateway cron ticker does not scan profile-local cron stores.
6. Dangerous-command approvals are bridged back to the router with a
   multitenant gateway session key plus child-local `HERMES_SESSION_KEY` /
   `HERMES_GATEWAY_SESSION` / `HERMES_EXEC_ASK`, so terminal/process guard
   worker threads resolve the same approval callback. The AIAgent child emits
   `approval_required` / `approval_resolved` NDJSON events; the parent stream
   parser forwards them to the router, and `/approve` / `/deny` resolves the
   child through a decision file. The core terminal guard runs before
   sandbox/environment creation so an approval prompt is not blocked by
   environment startup.
7. Slash commands are handled by Hermes gateway/plugin/skill control paths and
   unknown slash commands return an unknown-command reply instead of entering the
   LLM prompt.

## Enable

```bash
hermes plugins enable platforms/feishu-multitenancy
hermes gateway restart
```

## Configure Routes

Create one Hermes profile per tenant persona:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/profiles/alice ~/.hermes/profiles/bob
$EDITOR ~/.hermes/profiles/alice/SOUL.md
$EDITOR ~/.hermes/profiles/bob/SOUL.md
```

Apply a route file:

```bash
python plugins/platforms/feishu-multitenancy/sync.py apply users.json
```

Example `users.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "user_id": "alice",
    "profile_name": "alice",
    "open_id": "ou_xxx",
    "union_id": "on_xxx"
  },
  {
    "user_id": "bob",
    "profile_name": "bob",
    "open_id": "ou_yyy",
    "union_id": "on_yyy"
  }
]
```

New routes should use Feishu `open_id` (`ou_*`). `union_id` remains available
for legacy migration rows.

## Shared Feishu App

The plugin expects the gateway/default Hermes home to own the Feishu app
credentials and per-user Feishu user access token files. Do not duplicate app
credentials into every profile.

```text
~/.hermes/config.yaml                 # shared Feishu app config
~/.hermes/feishu_uat/<open_id>.json   # per-user token files
~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/         # isolated SOUL, .env, config, memory
```

## Auto-Provisioning

Auto-provisioning is enabled by default:

```bash
HERMES_MULTITENANCY_AUTO_PROVISION=1
```

An unseen sender `ou_new_user` gets a deterministic profile path such as:

```text
~/.hermes/profiles/feishu_ou_new_user/
```

The profile is seeded from the shared Hermes config where possible. If the
shared config does not define a model, configure the generated profile before
expecting AIAgent replies.

Disable auto-provisioning with:

```bash
HERMES_MULTITENANCY_AUTO_PROVISION=0
```

## Tenant-boundary controls

- Session history and gateway slash session keys are scoped by `(profile,
  canonical sender)`; alternate IDs are route lookup helpers only.
- Gateway and plugin slash handlers run under the routed profile's
  `HERMES_HOME`, serialized so concurrent slash commands cannot observe another
  profile's environment.
- Cron/reminder jobs use the shared Hermes cron store watched by the gateway
  ticker; profile-local `cron/jobs.json` files are intentionally avoided.
- Dangerous-command approval prompts are delivered by the parent router and
  resolved by `/approve` / `/deny` through a decision file; child-local session
  env covers tool worker threads that do not inherit contextvars, and the
  parent stream parser must forward child `approval_required` /
  `approval_resolved` events instead of dropping them.
- Outbound `MEDIA:<path>` file replies are delivered only when the target path
  resolves inside the routed profile home.
- `quick_commands` entries with `type: exec` are disabled by default for Feishu
  multitenancy. Enable them only after profile sandboxing is enforced:

```yaml
multitenancy:
  allow_quick_exec: true
```

or:

```bash
HERMES_MULTITENANCY_ALLOW_QUICK_EXEC=1
```

Allowed exec commands inherit the routed profile's `HERMES_HOME`.

## Toolsets

When a profile sets `platform_toolsets.feishu`, the plugin defaults to merging
those explicit entries with Hermes' default Feishu toolsets. This preserves
general capabilities such as `web_search` / `web_extract` while still allowing
per-profile Feishu tool additions.

For a strictly narrowed schema, set:

```yaml
multitenancy:
  toolsets_mode: explicit
```

or export:

```bash
HERMES_MULTITENANCY_TOOLSETS_MODE=explicit
```

## Verify

```bash
hermes plugins list
sqlite3 ~/.hermes/multitenancy.db \
  'select open_id, profile_name, active from multitenancy_routing;'
```

Then send the same prompt from two Feishu users to the same bot. The gateway
log should show distinct sender `ou_*` values and distinct profile homes.

## Notes

- No Hermes core files are patched.
- The plugin uses Feishu `open_id` first and only falls back to alternate IDs
  for legacy rows.
- AIAgent runs in an isolated subprocess so tool calls can execute without
  blocking the gateway event loop.
