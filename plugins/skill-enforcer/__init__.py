"""skill-enforcer plugin — periodic compliance checkpoints during agent execution.

Addresses the "having rules ≠ following rules" problem.

PR #18316 (hybrid mode) already selects relevant skills and injects them into
the system prompt. This plugin doesn't duplicate that. Instead, it forces
periodic compliance checkpoints to make sure the agent is actually FOLLOWING
the rules in the loaded skills, not just having them in context.

Design:
- Tracks action tool call count per session
- Every N action tool calls, BLOCK with a compliance checkpoint message
- The checkpoint asks: "are you following the rules in your loaded skills?"
- Agent acknowledges by calling any self-check tool (skill_view, hindsight_recall, etc.)
- Counter resets after acknowledgment
- Non-action tools (read, search, explore) don't count
- This is NOT a one-time gate — it's periodic enforcement throughout the session
