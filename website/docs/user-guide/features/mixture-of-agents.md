# Mixture of Agents

The **Mixture of Agents** (MoA) tool runs your prompt through several frontier models in parallel (the *reference* layer), then feeds the collected answers to a single aggregator model that synthesizes a final response. It is most useful for hard one-shot questions where you want to trade latency and token spend for higher answer quality.

MoA is part of the `moa` toolset. It is OFF by default; enable it from the setup checklist or by adding `moa` under `enabled_toolsets` in `config.yaml`.

## Configuring the roster

MoA is configured entirely from `~/.hermes/config.yaml` under the `moa:` key. The module constants inside `tools/mixture_of_agents_tool.py` are fallbacks; do not edit them.

```yaml
moa:
  enabled: true
  reference_models:
    - {model: anthropic/claude-opus-4.7,       provider: openrouter, reasoning: xhigh}
    - {model: google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview,   provider: openrouter, reasoning: xhigh}
    - {model: openai/gpt-5.5-pro,              provider: openrouter, reasoning: xhigh}
    - {model: qwen/qwen3.6-plus,               provider: openrouter, reasoning: xhigh}
  aggregator_model:
    model: anthropic/claude-opus-4.7
    provider: openrouter
    reasoning: xhigh
  reference_temperature: 0.6
  aggregator_temperature: 0.4
  min_successful_references: 2
```

Every entry in `reference_models` and `aggregator_model` accepts:

- `model` — the provider-native model slug.
- `provider` — any provider accepted by the main agent's router (`openrouter`, `openai-codex`, `nous`, `anthropic`, `copilot`, `ai-gateway`, `custom`, …). Defaults to `openrouter` if omitted.
- `reasoning` *(optional)* — a standard Hermes reasoning effort or `none`. Omit the key (or set `null` / `""`) to send no MoA-specific reasoning override.

In PR1, reasoning overrides are forwarded only for `openrouter`, `nous`,
`ai-gateway`, and `openai-codex`. For other providers, MoA logs once and omits
the override so the provider default applies; provider-specific request kwargs
are deferred to PR2.

A bare string is accepted as shorthand for `{model: <string>, provider: openrouter}`.

### Kill switch

Set `moa.enabled: false` to disable the tool without touching `enabled_toolsets`. Preflight will refuse to run, and calls to the tool return a structured failure (`error: "MoA disabled via moa.enabled=false"`). Invalid config under a disabled block still raises at load time — errors are not deferred.

### `min_successful_references`

Defaults to `min(2, len(reference_models))` so a typical 3–4 model roster tolerates one reference failure. Set it explicitly to override. Values outside `[1, len(reference_models)]` fail validation.

## Interaction with `/model` and `/reasoning_effort`

MoA keeps its own roster — **`/model` does not cascade into MoA**. Switching the main agent's model has no effect on the reference or aggregator models used by the tool.

Similarly, **`/reasoning_effort` only affects the main agent loop**. MoA entries each carry their own `reasoning` field, and the tool does not read the session-level reasoning effort. If you want MoA to track a change, update both `/reasoning_effort` *and* the relevant `reasoning:` fields under `moa:`.

## Provider cost warning

Routing multiple reference models through `openai-codex` multiplies consumption against the Codex plan's daily cap. The tool logs a one-time warning per Codex-routed config shape; take it seriously if you're on a metered plan.

## Credentials

`check_moa_requirements` is config-aware: it asks Hermes' provider resolver to create a client for every `provider` in your roster (including the aggregator). An all-Codex roster with Codex credentials will pass even when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is unset. A mixed roster needs credentials for every provider it touches.

## Debug mode

Set `MOA_TOOLS_DEBUG=true` in your environment to dump per-call metadata (provider, resolved model, reasoning kwargs, reference successes/failures, final response length) to the Hermes debug directory.
