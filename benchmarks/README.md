# Agent Memory Benchmark Suite

A system-agnostic benchmark for evaluating AI agent memory systems across 424 scenarios, 19 benchmark categories, and 15 suites. It measures retrieval quality, contradiction handling, scope isolation, adversarial robustness, scale handling, feedback-driven reranking, and multi-agent memory behaviors.

This repository currently includes:
- 7 adapter implementations under `benchmarks/backends/`
- 6 checked-in result bundles under `benchmarks/results/`
- 22 benchmark tests across 9 test files in `tests/benchmarks/`

## What This Benchmarks

Memory systems are evaluated on dimensions that matter for real agent use:

1. Can it find what it stored? — semantic recall vs keyword overlap
2. Does it know what is current? — contradictions, temporal integrity
3. Can it isolate context? — scopes and boundary handling
4. Does it resist manipulation? — adversarial prompt/instruction injection
5. Does it scale? — retrieval under 10–1000 fact loads
6. Does it learn from feedback? — reward-driven reranking
7. Does it preserve delegated and compressed context? — compression survival and delegation memory

## Quick Start

```bash
# Fast smoke test: one backend, one small suite, one seed
python -m benchmarks --backend baseline-flat --suite d --runs 1 --seeds 42

# Multi-seed local run for stronger evidence
python -m benchmarks --backend baseline-flat --suite all --runs 5 --seeds 42 43 44 45 46

# Compare two stored result files
python -m benchmarks --compare benchmarks/results/baseline-flat.json benchmarks/results/holographic.json

# Generate a markdown report from a stored result file
python -m benchmarks --report --result-file benchmarks/results/baseline-flat.json
```

Total: 424 scenarios across 19 categories and 15 suites.

## Implemented Adapters

Adapter implementations currently present in-tree:
- `baseline-flat`
- `byterover`
- `hindsight`
- `holographic`
- `honcho`
- `mem0`
- `openviking`
- `retaindb`

Checked-in result artifacts are currently included for these 6 backends:
- `baseline-flat`
- `hindsight`
- `holographic`
- `honcho`
- `mem0`
- `retaindb`

`openviking` and `byterover` are implemented but are not included in the checked-in comparison bundle yet.

## Methodology

### Judge Modes

Heuristic judge (default):
- 75% keyword threshold
- trigram overlap requirement
- deterministic and cheap
- biased toward verbatim/near-verbatim returns

LLM judge (opt-in):
- semantic equivalence checking
- slower and costs money
- better for publication-quality semantic comparisons

For serious cross-backend claims, prefer rerunning with `--judge llm` or reporting both heuristic and LLM outcomes.

### Capability-Aware Execution

Backends declare support through `BackendCapabilities`. Categories that require unsupported capabilities are skipped instead of being counted as failures. This prevents punishing a backend for lacking features outside its design scope.

### Shared-Suite Aggregation

Aggregate comparisons should use only categories that all compared backends actually ran. The checked-in `COMPARISON_REPORT.md` includes a shared-suite table for this reason.

### Seeds and Statistical Validity

The framework supports multi-seed runs, confidence intervals, and significance testing.

Important honesty note: the checked-in result JSON files in `benchmarks/results/` are currently single-seed snapshots (`num_runs = 1`). They are useful for development and qualitative comparison, but they are not strong statistical evidence. Re-run with 5 seeds before making publication-strength claims.

## Interpreting Results

What scores mean:
- Per-category scores: fraction of scenarios passed in that category
- Overall score: mean across the categories a backend actually ran
- Shared-suite mean: mean across only the categories run by every backend in the comparison set

What scores do not mean:
- A single higher score does not prove a universally better memory system
- Scores from heuristic judge and LLM judge are not directly interchangeable
- Full-suite means across different category subsets can mislead; shared-suite means are fairer

## Known Limitations

1. Heuristic judge bias: lexical overlap is still favored over paraphrase.
2. Checked-in result bundle is single-seed: useful, but not statistically strong.
3. External/service backends vary in reset semantics and environmental dependencies.
4. Result quality depends on backend environment quality (API keys, local services, embedding providers).

## Running the Benchmark Test Suite

```bash
pytest tests/benchmarks -q
```

Current benchmark test status in this cleaned branch: 22 tests passing.

## Adding a New Backend

1. Implement `BenchmarkableStore` in `benchmarks/backends/<name>_adapter.py`
2. Export:
   - `BACKEND_NAME`
   - `BACKEND_CLASS`
   - `BACKEND_CAPABILITIES`
3. Smoke test it:

```bash
python -m benchmarks --backend <name> --suite d --runs 1 --seeds 42
```

4. Add focused tests under `tests/benchmarks/`

## Academic Benchmark Adapters

In addition to the synthetic scenario suite, the framework includes adapters for
established external benchmarks.  These run independently of the suite A–O
framework and are invoked via `python -m benchmarks --academic`.

### LongMemEval

Integrates the [LongMemEval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval) benchmark
(ICLR 2025) with the Hermes memory system.  500 questions drawn from
`xiaowu0162/longmemeval-cleaned` on HuggingFace, covering temporal-reasoning,
multi-session recall, knowledge-update, and single-session question types.
See [`benchmarks/longmemeval/README.md`](longmemeval/README.md).

### LoCoMo

Integrates the [LoCoMo](https://github.com/snap-research/LoCoMo) benchmark
(arXiv:2402.17753, Snap Research) — ~50 long conversations, ~2,000 QA pairs
from `snap-research/locomo` on HuggingFace, covering single-hop, multi-hop,
temporal, and open-domain question types.
See [`benchmarks/locomo/README.md`](locomo/README.md).

### HotpotQA

Evaluates multi-hop question answering using the HotpotQA dataset
(arXiv:1809.09600, Yang et al., 2018).  500-question stratified sample from the
distractor-split validation set.  Primary metric is `supporting_facts_recall`
— whether the store retrieves the gold paragraphs needed to answer the question.
See [`benchmarks/hotpotqa/README.md`](hotpotqa/README.md).

### ConvoMem

Integrates the [ConvoMem](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/ConvoMem)
benchmark (arXiv:2511.10523, Salesforce AI Research) — 75,336 QA pairs from
`Salesforce/ConvoMem` on HuggingFace, covering 6 evidence types
(`abstention_evidence`, `assistant_facts_evidence`, `changing_evidence`,
`implicit_connection_evidence`, `preference_evidence`, `user_evidence`) at
n_evidence levels 1–6.  Note: the HuggingFace streaming API returned a PyArrow
schema error; the adapter uses direct HTTP fetching via `urllib.request` — see
the adapter docstring for details.
See [`benchmarks/convomem/README.md`](convomem/README.md).
