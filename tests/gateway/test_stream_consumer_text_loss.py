"""Tests for GatewayStreamConsumer — accumulated text preservation on send failure.

When _send_new_chunk fails during the chunk-splitting path (lines 188-193),
_accumulated is cleared unconditionally even if sends failed, causing text
loss.  The fix: only clear _accumulated after confirming all chunks were
delivered.
