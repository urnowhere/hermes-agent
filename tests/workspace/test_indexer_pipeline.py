"""End-to-end tests for the Pipeline-based indexer.

Exercises the behavior the workspace indexer is expected to produce
after migrating from manual Chonkie wiring to `chonkie.Pipeline`:

- Markdown files emit one ChunkRecord per modality (text/code/table/image)
  with the correct `kind`, and no legacy block_index/src/link/row_count metadata.
- Small markdown files with a code block are still split into two records
  (prose + code) rather than collapsed into a single chunk.
- Overlap context is populated and is a suffix of the previous chunk's content.
- Deprecated config keys (strategy, threshold) are silently ignored.
- Config signature changes cause re-indexing.
