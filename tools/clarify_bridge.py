"""
Gateway bridge for the ``clarify`` tool.

The interactive CLI has always been able to pause the agent and ask the user a
question via ``tools.clarify_tool`` + ``HermesCLI._clarify_callback``.  The
gateway did not wire that callback — any attempt to use ``clarify`` from a
messaging platform (Telegram, Discord, …) returns
``"Clarify tool is not available in this execution context."``.

This module provides the gateway-side glue, mirroring the proven pattern used
for dangerous-command approvals in ``tools/approval.py``:

1. The gateway registers a per-session *notify* callback via
   :func:`register_gateway_clarify_notify` before starting an agent turn.
2. The gateway injects :func:`gateway_clarify_callback` as the agent's
   ``clarify_callback``.
3. When the agent calls ``clarify``, that callback creates a
   :class:`_ClarifyEntry` (question + choices + ``threading.Event``), invokes
   the notify callback (which the gateway uses to send the question to the
   user), then blocks on the event.
4. When the next user message arrives, the gateway routes it to
   :func:`resolve_gateway_clarify` instead of starting a new turn.  That sets
   the event and the agent thread resumes with the user's answer.

Thread safety: all shared state is guarded by ``_lock``.  Each blocked agent
thread has its own ``threading.Event``; parallel clarifies are supported via a
FIFO queue per session.
