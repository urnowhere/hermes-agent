"""
Subagent Memory Write Tool

Provides append-only, rate-limited memory persistence for subagents.

When the parent enables write_memory=True on delegate_task, the subagent
gets this tool. Writes route through whatever memory provider the parent
has active -- builtin MEMORY.md, mem0, Honcho, or any other registered
provider. If the parent has no memory store, the tool returns a clear error
instead of silently discarding the write.

Constraints (enforced here):
  - Append-only: no read, replace, or delete
  - 3 writes per subagent run (shared rate limit across tool calls)
  - 400 chars max per entry
  - Content tagged [subagent] prefix so the parent can identify the source
