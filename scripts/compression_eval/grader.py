"""Two-phase probe grading.

Phase 1 — **Continuation**: simulate the next assistant turn. Feed the
compressed message list plus the probe question and ask the continuing
model to answer using only the compressed context. This is exactly what
a real next-turn call would look like.

Phase 2 — **Grading**: a separate judge-model call scores the answer on
the six rubric dimensions using ``rubric.build_judge_prompt``.

Both phases use the OpenAI SDK directly against the resolved provider
endpoint, so the explicit api_key + base_url we pass always reaches the
wire. (``agent.auxiliary_client.call_llm`` is designed for task-tagged
auxiliary calls backed by config lookups; for eval we need the explicit
credentials to win unconditionally.)
